**Smart Accountant** is a next-generation financial platform that eliminates manual data entry. It uses an **Event-Driven Serverless Architecture** to ingest invoice PDFs, automatically extract financial data, and store it for instant analysis.

## 🏗 Architecture

The system uses an asynchronous pipeline to handle heavy processing without freezing the UI.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

### **Frontend (The Interface)**
* **React (Vite):** Blazing fast dashboard for uploading and viewing invoices.
* **AWS Amplify:** Handles CI/CD deployment and hosting.

### **Backend (The Engine)**
* **AWS Lambda (Python):** The compute layer that parses PDFs and runs business logic.
* **Amazon DynamoDB:** NoSQL database for storing invoice details (Date, Vendor, Amount).
* **Amazon S3:** Secure storage for raw and processed documents.
* **AWS SAM:** Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to deploy the entire backend in one command.

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap (The "Smart" Features)

* [ ] **🤖 GenAI Financial Analyst:** Integrate **AWS Bedrock (Claude 3)** to allow users to "chat" with their invoices (e.g., *"Why is my electric bill 20% higher this month?"*).
* [ ] **🚨 Automated Fraud Detection:** Add logic to flag duplicate invoice numbers or suspicious vendor names automatically.
* [ ] **📩 Smart Alerts:** Use **Amazon SNS** to text/email the user when a high-value invoice (> $1,000) is processed.
* [ ] **📊 One-Click Export:** Generate CSV/Excel reports compatible with QuickBooks or Xero.
